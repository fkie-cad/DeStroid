# DeStroid alpha version

This folder contains an early version of our prototype (the version used in our paper will be open sourced by the end of the year). 

## Why not the newest version and the full source code?

We are still working on improving the patching part. We wanted it to be more automatic, smooth and complete.
Unfortunately, it turned out that this is way more complicated than we expected. On the other hand, as this was a side project on which we
worked during our free time mostly, we are not able to continue the work right now. However, we still plan to release a version some time this year.

## So what does this version provides?

It provides an early version of our prototype which is able to decrypt strings when simple obfuscations are used. Further the patching routine is not able to patch all deobfuscated strings.
Furthermore this prototype was build for python2.7 and is using an older version of dexlib2 (library for parsing the bytecode from the target app).
